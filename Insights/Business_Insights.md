### Business Insights & Strategic Recommendations:-

# Executive Summary:-
This analysis evaluates **200,000 global sales transactions** across national and international markets using SQL. The objective was to identify **revenue drivers, customer behavior patterns, geographic performance, and operational inefficiencies**. The insights highlight strong revenue concentration in metro cities, high dependency on select international markets, and operational challenges related to delivery timelines and returns.
